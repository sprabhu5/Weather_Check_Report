# Weather_Check_Report

INTRODUCTION & APPROACH:
This contains the data behind the story [Where do people go to check the daily weather report]( http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/weather-forecast-news-app-habits). Data which I have worked on was collected in between April 6-10 and had 938 responses.
ANALYZE BY GROUPING THE DATA:
By using groupby() and aggregate functions specific groups were extracted, and results are as follows: Group1: People who took the survey are mostly between age group 45-59 or 60+
  were more likely to go to a specific website or app or The Weather Channel. The analysis of the same is done
below.
People who said they checked the weather every day
  
To analyze the data first step is to proceed with data cleaning. In order to get the clear vision of data, the rows
with no values especially on the on the age and income columns were deleted. All the other missing values were
replaced with NaN (an acronym for Not a Number) so that it’s easier to evaluate and conclude.
  Group2: People with income more than 125,000 and more are very less in the number comparatively people
 with their household income between 10,000 to 124,999.
 
 Group3: With this consideration we can say that people are very likely and somewhat likely to check daily
 weather report with smartwatch are higher than the people who are unlikely to check. But what about the people
 who do not check the daily weather report but are likely to check if they have a smartwatch?
  Before drawing any conclusions , firstly I analyzed the data for the people who do not check the daily weather
 report(Figure:5). People who do not check the daily report are 140 in count. Even though there are these many
 people who do not check the daily report are likely or somewhat likely to buy smartwatch and check report on
 that. Hence people owning a smartwatch or promoting one is a plus.
  Group4: This set simply indicated that the people who are more likely to check daily weather report are much
 higher than the people who are unlikely to check.

 
ANALYSIS BASED ON INCOME FACTOR:
• 18-29 age group people earning between 0 to 24,999 are higher
• 30-44 age group people earning between 25,000 to 49,999 are higher
• 45-59 age group people earning between 100,000 to 124,999 are higher
• 60+ age group people earning between 25,000 to 75,999 are higher
• People who are very likely or somewhat likely to see report on device earn between 25,000 to124,999
• People who are very unlikely or somewhat unlikely to watch daily weather report earns between 25,000
to 75,999. People who do not check the weather report on smartwatch still check the report using different sources.
FINAL THOUGHTS:
More than 700 people check the weather report, out of which more than a half of those people rely on a
weather app of some kind either on their phones or a smartwatch. There are a few numbers of people who are
not likely to check the weather report on their smartwatch but since the count of those people is really low, we
can ignore them. In each group of income there are people who do not wish to use smartwatch or an application
to check the weather report. People not having such apps search for the report on the internet or even other
devices. Also, there are people who reply on weather channel or tv news. While analyzing data it is getting clear
that women are more likely to take this survey than men.
